Building a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier

This is a Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow and trained to recognize traffic signs. The dataset used is the German Traffic Sign Recognition dataset.

Training and Experimentation Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 96.18% on the official GTSRB test dataset.

All code, training results, and relevant explanations and comments are contained in the iPython notebook in this directory.
